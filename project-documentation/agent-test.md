## Product Manager Agent Test

**Test Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: âœ… Configured  

### Configuration Details

- **Agent Name**: product-manager
- **Configuration File**: `/home/david/cursor_project/.claude/agents/product-manager.md`

@product-manager "Analyze the request for adding a new user dashboard feature and create comprehensive product documentation"
```

### Usage Pattern

2. **Task Tool Integration**: The agent is now available through the task-master MCP
3. **Output Location**: All agent outputs will be saved to the `project-documentation` directory

### Verification

- [x] Agent configuration file created
- [x] MCP server (task-master) added
- [x] Project-level MCP configuration created
- [x] Agent registry created
- [x] Output directory structure established

The product-manager subagent is now ready for use in the Bibbi Parfum Sales Data Analytics Platform project.
